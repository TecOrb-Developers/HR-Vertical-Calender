This awesome calendar is designed to meet more complex business requirements for Android development.
And it's easy to make a custom perfect ui. This calender is more flexible to adapt different ui and
the complicated logic.

### Vertical Calendar
The vertical calendar is build with ListView whose child item is CalendarCard with some information text.
What you need to do is to `setAdapter` for the ListView.

## Custom the UI
If you have a better design for the calender, you'll find it's easy to change to another style. It's more
convenient than System Calendar ui kit.
